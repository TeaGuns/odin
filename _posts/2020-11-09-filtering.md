# Filtering

##### What is Filtering?

This is the process of choosing a smaller part of your data set and using that subset of the data for analysis & viewing. 

**_Example_**: Filtering the report to only show one Unit from the hospital. (Filtering is temporary, the complete data set is kept, but it is just hidden)

##### Why should I filter?

Filtering data makes the report easier for you the user to read and understand. Filtering enables you to only view the data that matters to you.

**_Example:_** A line chart with every unit may be tricky to read. However, a line chart filtered to the units that are of your concern id much easier to understand.

##### How can I filter?

Self Service Reports have buttons and dropdowns on every page. When these buttons or dropdowns are used, the report is ‘filtered’ to your needs**_._**

**_Example:  _**On the home page there are buttons to filter the Month/Year and the Hospital/Units. Clicking on any of these will ‘**filter**’ the report
